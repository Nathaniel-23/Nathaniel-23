- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nathaniel-23
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to program in multiple languages and their applicatons. i'm mainly interested in game developing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, though i'd like to learn C++ or JavaScript if i have the chance.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything just yet, as i don't have much advanced knowledge in proggraming.
- 📫 Not interested in contacts, sorry!
